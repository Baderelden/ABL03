# Vehicle damage assessment demo

A Streamlit app using the OpenAI Responses API directly. No LangChain required.

## Included features

- LLM dropdown, including GPT-4.1 mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-5 mini, GPT-5 and GPT-6 Astra; configurable through secrets.
- Multiple JPEG, PNG and WebP uploads with a four-column thumbnail gallery.
- All photographs sent together for one vehicle assessment.
- Very short description, standardised parts and damage table, evidence photo numbers.
- Image-based repair size with explanation, supporting photos and confidence.
- Unique observed body-panel count retained as descriptive information only.
- Estimated active repair labour range, assumptions and relevant special needs.
- Possible damage distinguished from observed damage; insufficient evidence handled explicitly.
- Limitation and additional-photo fields omitted from model output to reduce output tokens.
- Downloadable JSON report, session-only report storage and optional shared demo password.

## Run locally

Use Python 3.11 or 3.12. From this folder:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

Enter an OpenAI API key in the sidebar, or copy `.streamlit/secrets.toml.example`
to `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and replace the placeholder. Never commit the real secrets file.
An `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable also works. No key is bundled.

## Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud

1. Unzip the project. Put its contents in a GitHub repository, with `app.py`,
   `assessment.py` and `requirements.txt` at the repository root. Include
   `.streamlit/config.toml` and `.gitignore`; exclude `.venv`, caches and real secrets.
2. Open https://share.streamlit.io and connect the repository.
3. Create an app, select the repository and branch, and set the main file to `app.py`.
4. In Advanced settings, choose Python 3.11 or 3.12 and add these TOML secrets:

```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-real-openai-api-key"
OPENAI_MODELS = ["gpt-4.1-mini", "gpt-4.1", "gpt-5-mini", "gpt-5", "gpt-6-astra"]
APP_PASSWORD = "choose-a-long-random-demo-password"
```

5. Deploy. Open the app, enter the demo password, upload vehicle photos and click
   **Assess vehicle**. If you omit the server API key, users can enter their own
   key in the sidebar. The password is optional, but useful when your key funds requests.

This package is prepared for deployment; it has not been published to your account.

## Model configuration

The initial choices support image inputs, Responses and structured outputs.
Account permissions and availability can differ. To add other models, update
`OPENAI_MODELS` with exact API model IDs supporting both images and structured
outputs. This is a configured allowlist, not automatic model discovery.
GPT-5 mini, GPT-5 and GPT-6 Astra receive a 16,000-token output budget to
accommodate reasoning and the visible report. GPT-5 and GPT-6 Astra use low
reasoning effort. Other models may need their own settings in `assessment.py`.
If an existing deployment sets OPENAI_MODELS in secrets, update that list too;
it overrides the code defaults.

## Counting rules and scope

The fixed part vocabulary lives in `assessment.py`. It uses familiar British body
repair names, not an insurer/OEM parts coding standard. Left/right is the vehicle's
own orientation. Unknown part identity stays unclassified instead of guessing.

The default panel list includes bumper covers, bonnet, roof, boot lid/tailgate,
wings, rear quarter panels, doors and sills. Glass, lamps, mirrors, wheels and
other components are reported but excluded from the panel count. Each observed
panel counts once across all photos; possible damage is excluded. This count no
longer determines repair size. The model uses a qualitative visual rubric:

- Small: minor cosmetic damage with limited apparent repair work.
- Medium: localised collision damage needing substantive bodywork/replacement.
- Large: severe crushing, folding, tearing, major displacement, extensive damage
  or complex repair. A collapsed front end can be Large with few identified panels.
- No visible damage: no apparent damage in adequate photos, not a whole-vehicle guarantee.
- Not assessable: insufficient evidence for a size judgement.

The model explains its decision, cites photos and gives qualitative confidence.
These are demo definitions, not industry-standard categories or an economic
write-off decision. Hidden structural damage remains unconfirmed without inspection.
Several lightly scratched panels can be Small; a severely crushed area can be Large.
The rules are in PROMPT in assessment.py and should be calibrated against labelled
workshop cases. No live evaluation on the user's collision photo has been performed.
Existing sessions are invalidated when switching to this sizing schema.
Replace both app.py and assessment.py when deploying this update; secrets are unchanged.

The standard list primarily covers passenger vehicles. Special truck body panels
use Other / unidentified part; extend the vocabulary before using this for detailed
commercial-body assessments. Truck handling requirements can still be reported.

Hours are an LLM estimate of active labour, not elapsed days, manufacturer labour
book times or a guaranteed quotation. The model can return no estimate if evidence
is insufficient. Panel count measures extent, not severity. A single panel can
still have serious damage. Inspection is needed before repair or safety decisions.

Electric/hybrid status should be supplied in the optional vehicle details when
known. The model must label uncertain requirements rather than invent a powertrain.

## Implementation and data handling

`client.responses.parse(..., text_format=Assessment)` validates structured output
with Pydantic. All images are included in one request. The model supplies a visual repair-size category independently of the descriptive
panel count, with an explanation and supporting photo references. Reports are invalidated
when photos, notes or model selection change.

Photos are re-encoded without EXIF, resized to at most 768 pixels, and sent as
base64 data URLs with high detail. The demo accepts up to 12 images, 10 MB each,
40 MB total and 25 megapixels per image. Smaller images reduce request size but
may lose fine damage detail; upload close-ups when needed.

The app does not write uploaded images to disk or a database. Uploads and results
remain in Streamlit session memory; Clear photos and assessment removes the app's
current references. This is not a promise of secure memory erasure. Requests set
`store=False`; this does not establish zero retention or data compliance by itself.
The demo password is a shared access gate, not full user management or rate limiting.

## Verification

Run the included offline checks:

```bash
python -m unittest -v
```

Checks cover size independent of panel count, unassessable inputs, duplicate panels, excluding possible/non-panel
damage, invalid hour ranges, image conversion, actual SDK parsing with a mocked
HTTP response and refusals. The initial Streamlit screen was also smoke-tested.
The GPT-5/GPT-6 update passed the expanded mocked SDK checks and dropdown
smoke test. No live API call or real-photo accuracy evaluation was performed. Validate against
repairer-labelled cases before using output for operational estimates.
